%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% a) Write a SCRIPT to verify that computers do indeed make mistakes
%    - Create a loop that adds 0.1 to a variable 10 times done
%    - Display the result done
%    - Does this give you the correct answer of 0.1 * 10 = 1? Yes
%    - ARE YOU SURE ITS CORRECT?  Try subtracting 1.0 to see the difference yes
%    - How large is the error in the calculation? No error
%
% b) Write a SCRIPT where you vectorize the above code:
%    - Create a 1x10 vector of values equal to 0.1 done
%    - Use the sum function to sum them done
%    - What is the error in this case? No error
%    - Use the functions 'tic' and 'toc' to determine whether
%      the vectorized code is faster or slower than the above code.  Faster
%      Note that you may have to loop through the calculation many 
%      times to get a good estimate.  Make sure you get a good estimate!
%
% c) Write a FUNCTION called myCOSINE to be used as such:  y = myCOSINE(x)
%    to compute the values of cos(x) correct to three decimal places.
%    Use the Taylor series below to do this.  How many terms will you need
%    to make sure that the result is accurate to three decimal places?
%       cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ...
%    Be warned that this Taylor series is an approximation for x close to zero.
%    You may need to take advantage of some of the symmetries of the cosine 
%    to extend your function all the way out to 2pi.
%    - Prepend the function header below to your function and fill in the
%      details as instructed.  USE THIS FOR ALL FUNCTIONS!
%
% d) Write a SCRIPT that compares myCOSINE() to cos()
%    - On a SINGLE plot display the cosine from 0 to 2pi using each function
%      Color MATLAB's cos() function using RED
%      Color your myCOSINE() function using BLUE
%    - Create a second plot showing the difference between the two functions
%
% e) Write a SCRIPT that estimates the probability that one will roll:
%    - At least one six when rolling 6 six-sided dice.
%	 - At least two sixes when rolling 12 six-sided dice.
%	 - At least three sixes when rolling 18 six-sided dice.
%    Comment on the results and whether they make sense to you.
%
% Your results, summary, plots and comments should be pressented in a short (~2 page) 
% written report (pdf please).  A zip file containing your code and your pdf report
% should be submitted to knuthclass@gmail.com
